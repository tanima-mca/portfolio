        Iâ€™m a passionate frontend developer with a strong foundation in modern
        web technologies like Next.js and TypeScript. I enjoy solving problems
        through code and bringing intuitive, responsive user interfaces to life.
        From designing clean layouts to optimizing performance, I take pride in
        writing scalable, maintainable code that enhances the user experience.
        Whether it is building full-stack applications or fine-tuning frontend
        interactions, I am always eager to learn, build, and grow as a
        developer.
